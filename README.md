# Hi there 👋 I'm Vivek Haldar

## About Me

I'm a programmer, engineering leader, writer and YouTuber. 

I currently lead AI Agent Engineering at [Emergence AI](https://emergence.ai). The first 18 years of my career (2006-2024) were spent at Google, in various capacities: software engineer, tech lead, engineering manager. 

I've been writing my blog at [vivekhaldar.com](https://vivekhaldar.com) for more than 15 years. On my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@VivekHaldar) I cover the latest research in systems, AI and LLMs, with the occasional tutorial and hot take.
